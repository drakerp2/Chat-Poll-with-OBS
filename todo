Add integration with the OBS api to refresh browser source automatically (high priority)
	obspython library not available with PyPy and built exclusively for windows, will need to re-wrap needed libraries from OBS' core C API and make custom compiles to allow for cross platform support (I am on linux)

Refactor asyncio and multiprocessing to instead just use threading (high priority)

Create real unit tests before I gauge my eyes out manually running tests over and over again

Make random colors associate with keys rather than positions (as an option, because why not)

Get someone to build a real frontend that isn't scuffed html and pyplots piped through websockets (low priority, I have someone in mind, but he is currently tied up in a different project)

impliment rgb color pickers on the control pannel

add more sufisticated CLI functionality/options
	Allow custom ports to be set 

Figure out a way for it to automatically detect the user's stream
